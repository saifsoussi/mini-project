<p class="center"  > <a id="red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Red_Crescent"  target="_blanck" > The Tunisian Red Crescent (TRC) </a> is an organization of public interest that was founded in October 1956 as a Tunisian
humanitarian association. After getting recognized by a decree, it became a member of <a id="red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement#:~:text=The%20International%20Federation%20of%20Red,assistance%20missions%20responding%20to%20large%2D " target="_blanck" > the International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFCR) </a>  in September 1957 and has 21 regional branches and 244 local committees.  </p>
  <h3> the movement of red cross and red crescent has been founded on 7 fundamental Principles : </h3> 
 <div class="ur" >
   <ul   >
     <li style="opacity: initial;" > <span id="red"  > <strong> Humanity </strong> </span> <br> The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to
    the wounded on the battlefield, endeavours, in its international and national capacity, to prevent and alleviate human
    suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being.
    It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace amongst all peoples. </li> <br>
    <li><span id="red"> <strong> Impartiality </strong> </span><br> It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions. It endeavours to
   relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases
   of distress. </li> <br>
     <li><span id="red"> <strong> Neutrality </strong> </span> <br> In order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any
    time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature. </li> <br>
     <li><span id="red"> <strong> Independence </strong> </span> <br> The Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments
    and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at
    all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement. </li> <br>
     <li><span id="red"> <strong> Voluntary service </strong> </span> <br> It is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire for gain.</li> <br>
     <li><span id="red"> <strong> Unity </strong> </span> <br> There can be only one Red Cross or one Red Crescent Society in anyone country. It must be open to all. It must carry on
    its humanitarian work throughout its territory.</li> <br>
     <li><span id="red"> <strong> Universality </strong> </span> <br> The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, in which all Societies have equal status and share equal
    responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide.</li> <br>
   </ul>
 </div> 

<br>
<br>
 <p style="font-size: larger;" > The seven Fundamental Principles provide an ethical, operational and institutional framework for the work of the Red
Cross and Red Crescent Movement around the world. They are at the core of the Movement's approach to helping people in
need during armed conflict, natural disasters and other emergencies. </p>
